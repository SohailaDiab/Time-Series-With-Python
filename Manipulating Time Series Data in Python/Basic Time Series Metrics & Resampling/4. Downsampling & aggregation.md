# 4. Downsampling & aggregation

Downsampling includes:
- Hour -> day
- Day -> month, etc.

Aggregated data can be represented as:
- Mean
- Median
- Value of your choice

## Convert daily frequency to monthly frequency
```py
df.resample('M').mean()
```
> Here, `.mean()` method is applied to aggregate the daily data to a single monthly value.

## Apply multiple aggregations at once 
Similar to `.groupby()` method, multiple aggregations can be applied at once using `.agg()` method and passing a list of aggregation functions.

```py
df.resample('M').agg(['mean','std'])
```
> This will create 2 columns, `mean` and `std`, each column with its respective aggregation function.

> The monthly graph is much smoother than the daily graph, since the monthly volatility has been averaged out.

## Resampling multiple time series

Examples:
- Using mean:
```py
df.resample('BM').mean()
```
- Using the first data point from each resampling period:
```py
df.resample('M').first()
```
