# 2. Changing the time series frequency: resampling
It is common, since we usually want to convert two time series to a common frequency to analyze them together.

- `DateTimeIndex`: set & change freq using `.asfreq()`
- Frequency conversion affects the data:
  - **Upsampling**: Missing data (NaNs)
  - **Downsampling**: Aggregate existing data
