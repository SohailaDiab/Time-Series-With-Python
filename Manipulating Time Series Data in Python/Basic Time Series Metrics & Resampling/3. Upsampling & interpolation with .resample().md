# 3. Upsampling & interpolation with .resample()

The `.resample()` method is follows a similar logic to `.groupby()`:
- It groups data within a resampling period, and applies a method to this group.
- It takes the value that results from this method, and assigns a new date within the resampling period.
- The new date is determined by offset, which can be at the beginning or end of the period, or a custom location.

`.resample()` can be used to apply methods that either fill or interpolate missing date when upsampling, or that aggregate when downsampling.

## Resampling period & frequency offsets
Depending on the context, you can resample to the beginning or end of either the calendar or business month.

**Example Dates:**
| Frequency  | Alias | Sample Date |
|-------|-----|--------|
| Calendar Month Start   | MS  | 2017-04-01 |
| Calendar Month End | M  | 2017-04-30 |
| Business Month Start   | BMS  | 2017-04-03 |
| Business Month End | BM  | 2017-04-28 |

> This shows how business dates may deviate from the calendar month due to weekends and holidays.

## Resampling logic
### Upsampling

- When **upsampling**, there will be more resampling periods than data points.
- Each resampling period will have a given date offset, eg. month-end frequency.
- You will need to decide how to create data for the new resampling periods.
- The new data points will be assigned to the date offsets.

### Downsampling

- When **downsampling**, there will be more data points than resampling periods.
- Therefore, you will need to decide how to aggregate your data to obtain a single value for each date offset.

## Assign frequency with `.resample()`
```py
df.resample('MS') # Creates resampler object, frequency is Month Start

>> Output:
DateTimeIndexResampler [freq=<MonthBegin>, axis=0, closed=left, label=left, convention=start, base=0]
```
> `df.resample('MS').asfreq()` is the same as doing `df.asfreq('MS')`.

> The `.asfreq()` method is applied to assign the data to their offset without modification.

## Convert a series with no frequency to month start frequency
```py
df.head(2) # Initial df

>> Output:
            gpd
DATE
2000-01-01  1.2
2000-04-01  7.8
```

```py
df.resample('MS').ffill().add_suffix('_ffill')

>> Output:
            gpd_ffill
DATE
2000-01-01  1.2
2000-02-01  1.2
2000-03-01  1.2
2000-04-01  7.8
```
## Interpolate the missing values
`.interpolate()`: Fill in the values that lie on a straight line between existing data.

```py
df.resample('MS').interpolate().add_suffix('_inter')

>> Output:
            gpd_inter
DATE
2000-01-01  1.200000
2000-02-01  3.400000
2000-03-01  5.600000
2000-04-01  7.800000
```

> This shows that `.interpolate()` averages existing values.

> We can see how new data points lie on the line between existing points.

> On the other hand, forward filling creates a step-like pattern.
