# 3. Upsampling & interpolation with .resample()

The `.resample()` method is follows a similar logic to `.groupby()`:
- It groups data within a resampling period, and applies a method to this group.
- It takes the value that results from this method, and assigns a new date within the resampling period.
- The new date is determined by offset, which can be at the beginning or end of the period, or a custom location.

`.resample()` can be used to apply methods that either fill or interpolate missing date when upsampling, or that aggregate when downsampling.
