# 1. Compare time series growth rates
Analyzing time series growth rates.

As an example, you will be:
- Analyzing the performance of various stocks relative to each other, and against a benchmark.

**Problem:**
- It is not easy to compare time series trends since they start at different levels. We cannot do so using a simple chart.

**Solution:**
- Normalize all price series so that they start at the same value.
- You can do this by dividing each time series by its first value.
  - As a result, the first value equals one, and each subsequent price now reflect the relative change to the initial price.
- Multiply the normalized series by 100, and you get the relative change to the initial price in percentage. *(A price change from 100 t0 120 implies a 20% increase)*

## Normalizing a single series (Comparing one stock)
**1- Get the first (initial) value:**

```py
first_price = google.price.iloc[0] 
first_price

>> Output:
313.06
```

**2- Divide the series by the first value using `.div()`, and multiply the result by 100:**


```py
normalized = google.price.div(first_price).mul(100) 
normalized.plot(title='Google Normalized Series')

>> Output:
```

> We can see that the normalized series plot starts at 100.

> We can also see that Google's stock increased by 150 percentage points to around 2.5x its original value.

## Normalizing a multiple series (Comparing several stocks)
We will look at Google, Yahoo!, and Apple's stocks from 2010 through 2016.

**1- Get the first (initial) values:**
```py
prices.iloc[0]

>> Output:
APPL  30.57
GOOG  313.06
YHOO  17.10
Name: 2010-01-04 00:00:00, dtype float64
```

**2- Divide the series by the each of first values respectively using `.div()`, and multiply the result by 100:**

```py
normalized = prices.div(prices[0]) 
```

> `.div()`: automatic alignment of Series index & DataFrame columns.

## Plotting performance difference
Here, we will compare the 3 previous stocks to SP500 stock.

We will use SP500 as the benchmark and show the performance  difference for each stock relative to the benchmark in percentage points.

**1. Normalize the values by dividing each value by the initial value & multiply by 100 to get %**
```py
normalized = prices.div(prices.iloc[0]).mul(100)
```
**2. Subtract the normalized benchmark from the normalized values**
```py
diff = normalized[['GOOG','YHOO','APPL']].sub(normalized['SP500'], axis=0)
```
> `.sub(..., axis=0)`: Subtract a Series from each DataFrame column by aligning indexes.

*As a result, we can see how each stock perfromed relative to the benchmark.*
