# 3. Lags, changes, and returns for stock price series
Typical Time Series manipulations include:
- Shift or lag values forward or backward in time.
- Get the difference in value for a given time period.
- Compute the percent change over any number of periods.

`pandas` built-in methods rely on `pd.DateTimeIndex`.

## Using `pd.read_csv()` to parse
```py
google = pd.read_csv('google.csv', parse_dates=['date'], index_col='date']
```
> We can do this instead of using `to_datetime` function.

> We can also use the `index` parameter to set that date column as an index.

## `.shift()`: Moving data between past & future
This method allows to move all data in a Series or DataFrame into the past or future.

### Shift to future
Use `.shift(periods=+ve)`.
- The default is `periods=1`, which means moving one period into the future.

```py
google['shifted`] = google.price.shift() # default: periods=1
google.head(3)

>> Output:
            price   shifted
date
2015-01-02  542.81  NaN
2015-01-05  513.87  542.81
2015-01-06  501.96  513.87
```
> Since the values are shifted to the future by 1 period, the FIRST value will be `NaN`.

### Shift to past
Use `.shift(periods=-ve)`.
- Lagged data.
- Move period back in time

```py
google['lagged`] = google.price.shift(periods=-1)
google.tail(3)

>> Output:
            price   shifted   lagged
date
2015-01-02  785.05  791.55    782.79
2015-01-05  782.79  785.05    771.82
2015-01-06  771.82  782.79    NaN
```
> Since the values are shifted to the past by 1 period, the LAST value will be `NaN`.


Shifting data is useful to compare data at different points in time:
## Calculate one-period percent change
To calculate the rate of change from period to period.
Also called financial return in finance.

### `div()`
$x_t / x_{t-1}$

**`div()`** method allows you to not only divide a Series by a value, but by an entire Series. For instance, by another column in the same DataFrame.

```py
google['change'] = google.price.div(google.shifted)
google.head(3)

>> Output:
            price   shifted   change
date
2015-01-03  786.14  NaN       NaN
2015-01-04  786.90  786.14    1.000967
2015-01-05  794.02  786.90    1.009048
```
> As a result, the `change` column gives the relative change from the last period for every price. That is, the factor by which you need to multiply the last price to get the current price.

```py
google['return'] = google.change.sub(1).mul(100)
google.head(3)

>> Output:
            price   shifted   change   return
date
2015-01-02  542.81  NaN       NaN       NaN
2015-01-05  513.87  542.81    0.98      -2.08
2015-01-06  501.96  513.87    0.98      -2.32
```
> Here, we are:
> - subtracting 1 and 
> - multiplying the result by 100 
> to obtain the **relative change** in percentage terms.

### `diff()`: built-in time series change
$x_t - x_{t-1}$

**`div()`** method allows you to calculate the change between values at different points in time. It finds the difference in value for two adjacent periods.

```py
google['diff'] = google.price.diff()
google.head(3)

>> Output:
            price   diff    
date
2015-01-02  542.81  NaN
2015-01-05  513.87  -10.94
2015-01-06  501.96  -11.91
```

> To use this information to calculate **one period returns**:
> - Divide the absolute change by the shifted price.
> - Multiply by 100.

### `pct_change()`: built-in time-series to calc % change directly
$x_t / x_{t-1}$


```py
google['pct_change'] = google.price.pct_change().mul(100)
google.head(3)

>> Output:
            price   pct_change    
date
2015-01-02  542.81  NaN
2015-01-05  513.87  -2.08
2015-01-06  501.96  -2.32
```
