# 1. Rolling window functions with pandas

## Window functions
- Window functions allow you to operate on sub periods of your time series.
- Window functions calculate metrics for the data inside the window.
- The result of this calculation forms a new time series, where each data point represents a summary of several data points of the original time series.

## Types of windows:
- **Rolling windows:** They maintain the same size while they slide over the time series data. Each new data point is the result of a given number of observations.
- **Expanding windows:** Their size grows over the time series. The calculation that produces a new data point is the result of all previous data points.

## Rolling average

### Windows based on fixed # of observations
```py
data.rolling(window=30).mean() # fixed number of observations
```

> The window will contain the previous 30 observations.

> When an integer-based window size is chosen .. e.g. window = 30 or 10 or 50, pandas will only calculate the mean if the window has **no missing values**.<br>
> To change this, set the `min_periods` parameter to a value smaller than the window size.

### Windows based on date offsett
```py
data.rolling(window='30D').mean() # fixed period length
```
> The window will contain days during the last 30 calendar days

> **The period length is fixed. However, the number of observations may vary.**

## How the window size affects the time series
### 90 vs 360 day rolling average

> We can see that the larger the window size, the smoother the line will be.

## Multiple rolling metrics
Just like `.groupby()`, multiple functions can be aggregated.
```py
data.price.rolling.('90D').agg(['mean', 'std'])
```

```py
rolling = data.google.rolling('360D')
q10 = rolling.quantile(0.1).to_frame('q10')
median = rolling.median().to_frame('median')
q90 = rolling.quantile(0.9).to_frame('q90')

pd.concat([q10, median, q90], axis=1).plot()
```
